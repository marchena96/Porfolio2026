DarkModeSwitch 
Component created to switch between dark or light mode of the web site

We will use the React State to set it up.
1. import state
2. declare state
3. use state
4. setState

We can create a component
In the structure we will create the button using a chekbox tag

I want to change the state whe the user clicks on the button
I have to add the onChange atribute


Create a function where we are going to use the setState
